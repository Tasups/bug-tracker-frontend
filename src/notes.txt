Need to make the addNewComment function to add to the list of comments in the ticketsData.comments array and not add to the commentsData state that has been set. Consider looking at the handleTicketClick function to grab the id.

I think it may make more sense to set the state of all things tickets from the ticketsData store. Then pull down the comments and other things from that to centralize the data and not fracture the source of data by having a separate data-set to set state to. Thus, the ticket would have to be changed when making any changes, including the comments.

Next is to move state and such to Context

Consider moving much of what is in the Context file into a Redux component
