# bug-tracker-frontend
Bug tracker frontend using MERN stack
This is my large project. It's purpose is to help a team track their tickets and even manage projects. It will have authorization of user, roles enforced from Administration and Developer. The purpose is to show my ability to connect a large amount of data and display it dynamically as well as allow basic CRUD operations with persisitance.

## Tech Stack
<br>Front-End: React
<br>Back-End: Node, Express, and Mongoose
<br>Database: MongoDB

## Status
Currently still a WIP. This is my largest project to date. As of 08/11/22, I'm still working on the backend routes and controllers but most of it is built. I want to put in a Kanban board, but we'll see.
